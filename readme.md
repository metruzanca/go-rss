# Golang RSS Reader

Loosely inspired by Miniflux, another golang app.

## Goals

- RSS webapp
- SQLite (miniflux used postgresql, making it heavier than it needs to be for rasp-pi environments)

Nice to haves

- BubbleTea/Wish RSS app

## Development

Set `TURSO_DB_URL` & `TURSO_DB_TOKEN` environment variables.

Run `make start`

## Reources
